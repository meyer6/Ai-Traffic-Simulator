# Ai-Traffic-Simulator
An traffic simulation with an ai controlling the traffic lights  
Please note that the simulation runs at a higher speed by default  
  
**Some of the features implemented include:**  
- Interface to create a variety of different intersections, each with their own "busyness" and other traits
- Cars, buses/trucks, bikes/motorbikes. Each with their own properties (e.g. speed around corners) and spawn rates
- Pedestrians
- Collision prevention
- NEAT ai traffic light controller
- Round robin traffic light controller (For comparison)
- Variable car spawn rates
- Environmental statistics calculated
